        <h1>Dialog Response Selection</h1>
        <p>Each data sample consists of a base dialog context and several candidate responses. Your task is to choose the best response among all the candidates. Following is an example data sample,</p>
        <p><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U93bk.png" alt="Instructions" width="595" height="455" /></p>
        <p>In above example, the dialog context is <em>&ldquo;hello , i brought a lap - top computer with me . do you know how can i use the internet in my room ? &ldquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>There are 3 candidate responses available in this sample, you have to choose the best one among these. If you think <em>Response 1 </em>is the best available response, please label this as <em>1.</em></p>
        <p>For comparing the available responses you need to consider two aspects of the responses,&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Coherence of the response to the dialog context.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Grammatical correctness of the response.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><br /></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Read</strong> the dialog history/<strong>context</strong> carefully.</li>
            <li><strong>Read</strong> the <strong>individual</strong> <strong>responses</strong> carefully.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose the response label</strong> that best suits the context in terms of grammatical correctness and coherence to the context.</li>
