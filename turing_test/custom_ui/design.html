                    <p>Each data sample consists of a base dialog context and several candidate responses. Your task is to choose the best response among all the candidates. Following is an example data sample,</p>

                    <p>In above example, the dialog context is <em>&ldquo;hello , i brought a lap - top computer with me . do you know how can i use the internet in my room ? &ldquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>
                    <p>There are 3 candidate responses available in this sample, you have to choose the best one among these. If you think <em>Response 1 </em>is the best available response, please label this as <em>1.</em></p>
                    <p>For comparing the available responses you need to consider two aspects of the responses,&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><em>Coherence of the response to the dialog context.</em></li>
